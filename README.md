_rmesh_ is a site-specific rope+sound installation exploring autonomy and influence in a web of nodes.
Each autonomous agent (speaker) in the network amplifies vibrations and produces sound, sending the vibrations back into the network, feeding other agents and potentially itself. The sounds are generated by the feedback process of such vibrations.

Outside agents, such as the visitors, might also influence the web by touching it, feeling and interfering with it's self-vibrations.

The web's shape is determined by the location where it is installed, the composition follows a generative approach by re-routing, from time to time, which part of the web is being amplified by which agent (the speaker).


# technical

_rmesh_ uses SuperCollider running on the Bela.io platform for the sound processing and composition.

for _The Changing Room_ exhibition at _ACUD MACHT NEU_ in Berlin the materials used were:

* 500m of 6mm Jute rope (uses double rope and shibari inspired knots/rigging)
* 8 speakers
* 8 xpt8871 based mono amplifiers
* 9 piezo contact microphones
* beaglebone black + bela.io + bela audio expander capelet
* SuperCollider 3.10
